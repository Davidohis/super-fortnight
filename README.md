#Styled Components in Next.js

###Styling in Next.js
There are multiple ways of styling your components in a Next.js project, just like in any other React project. I prefer using styled-components though as they make it easy to modify the CSS and to have everything properly scoped out of the box, no worrying about clashing CSS classes and what not. This post will walk you through how to set up styled-components for your statically generated Next.js project.

Some other approaches to styling include:

Global styles (we will actually utilize this as well in a later tutorial in this series).
CSS Modules
Inline styling

 run  npm add -D styled-components babel-plugin-styled-components
